Day 1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

1> Nodejs is a javascript runtime built on google's open source V8 javascript engine.
2> Earlier we had already javascript in the browser. But if we bring javascript out of browser
   container to execute, then we must need any runtime env. So nodejs is that runtime environment 
   for javascript.
3> Earlier something like accesing file system or network capabilities were not possible using javascript,
   but now since we run javascript outside browser and inside nodejs env it is very much possible.
4> Single threaded, event driven and non-blocking I/O model.
5> can create server side web application.
6> we shouldn't use node for CPU intensive work like image processing or video conversion or file compression.

Day 2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

1> In cmd , type node -> enter -> tab(may be 1 or two times) we will see global variables in node.
   We can select any global variables/modules say fs.
   type fs and enter then we can see all methods and variable of this fs module.

2> Difference between require and import
   CommonJS - require, module.exports
   ES6 - impor/ export
   You can't selectively load only the pieces you need with require but with import, 
   you can selectively load only the pieces you need, which can save memory.
   Loading is synchronous(step by step) for require on the other hand 
   import can be asynchronous(without waiting for previous import) so it can perform a little better than require.

3> synchronous/blocking - Executes line by line. Current line blocks the execution of next line and it becomes worst if the 
                          next line is no way dependent on previous line.

   asynchronous/non-blocking - Current line doesn't block the next line execution.

4> As we know nodejs is single threaded and we register the callback of heavy task in node-api.Once its done, the
  callback moves to callback queue and event loop moves it to call stack after monitoring.
  Single threaded means simply one call stack to execute the lines of codes.

5> Writing callbacks doesn't make our code asynchronous automatically. We have predefined asynchronous methods already in
   node-api (in node) or web-api (in browser) like setTimeout(present in both nodeapi and webapi) or accessing files in node

6> If we make nested callbacks then it will become callback hell. we then use promise(es6) or async/await(es8) to get rid of this.

7> API is nothing but a request to get the resource/data.

8> lets "nodemon":"^1.18.11"
   it has three parts , 1 -> major version (any breaking changes)
                        18 -> minor version (any new implemention with backward compatible)
                        11 -> patch version (intended to fix bug)
                        ^ -> accepts minor and patch releases
                        ~ -> accepts only patch versions

   npm outdated -> it will give all outdated packages from our packages.json file
   npm updated slugify -> to update package
   *1.18.11 -> it will update major changes also
   npm uninstall slugify -> to remove

9> Server side rendering -> We build the app (html, css, js) on the server side and send the whole app 
                            to client(browser) to display

   Client side rendering -> We send the data in json format from server to client through api and client
                            consume those api with html cs and js to come up on the UI.
